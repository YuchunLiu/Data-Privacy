The code is written in Python 3.6.4 and TensorFlow 1.9.0

train_model.py: This file is used to train the basic classification model and the trained model is saved in the folder ./checkpoints/checkpoint. The saved model can be used to further experiments.

dataset.py/mnist.py/download.py/cache.py: These three files are used to load the dataset and read the images into the neural network. The files are mainly from the tutorial: https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials. The MNIST dataset is stored in the folder ./data 

ifgsm.py: This is the main file to implement the different adversarial attacks and compare their effect on the classification model. 

gene_adver.py: The program is written to generate the adversarial examples using a specific attack. In the code, we defined the basic one-step FGSM model and the generated images will be saved in the adv.npy file and the true labels will be save in the onehotlabel.npy file.

adver_training.py: The generated adversarial examples are input into the adversarial training model. The model also read some clean images and the trained model is saved in the folder ./checkpoints/adv/checkpoints.

./results: All output images and images used in the presentation are saved in the folder.

Data_Privacy_Final_Report.pdf: The report of the project.
